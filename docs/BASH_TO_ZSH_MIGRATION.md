# Bash to ZSH Migration Guide

## Overview

All shell scripts in the Private Blockchain project have been migrated from Bash to ZSH (Z Shell) to improve portability, maintainability, and feature support. This document details the changes made and provides guidance for script usage.

## üîÑ Changes Made

### 1. Shebang Line Updates
- **Before**: `#!/bin/bash`
- **After**: `#!/usr/bin/env zsh`

The new shebang format improves portability by using the environment to locate the ZSH interpreter rather than assuming a fixed path.

### 2. Script Path Resolution
- **Before**: `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` (Bash-specific variable)
- **After**: `$0` (Standard in ZSH)

Example:
```zsh
# Old Bash code
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# New ZSH code
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
```

### 3. Function Export Changes
- **Before**: `export -f function_name` (Bash-specific)
- **After**: No export needed (ZSH automatically exports functions when sourced)

### 4. Version Standardization
All scripts now include a standardized version number (currently 1.0.1) in their header comments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Benefits of ZSH

1. **Better Portability**: Using `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` ensures scripts work across different Unix-like systems regardless of where ZSH is installed.

2. **Improved Function Handling**: ZSH has better function scope management and doesn't require explicit function exports.

3. **Enhanced Features**: ZSH offers improved command completion, path expansion, and scripting capabilities.

4. **Modern Default**: ZSH is now the default shell on macOS and many Linux distributions.

5. **Better Error Handling**: More consistent error reporting and handling.

## üìã Migration Checklist

If you're creating new scripts or maintaining existing ones, ensure:

1. ‚úÖ Use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` as the shebang line
2. ‚úÖ Use `$0` instead of `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` for script path resolution
3. ‚úÖ Don't use `export -f` for functions
4. ‚úÖ Include version number in format: `# Version: 1.0.1`
5. ‚úÖ Source shared functions using: `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/shared-functions.sh"`

## üîç Compatibility Notes

- All scripts remain backward compatible with their original functionality
- No changes to script usage or parameters were made
- Environment variables work the same way in both Bash and ZSH
- Scripts can still be called the same way: `./script_name.sh`
